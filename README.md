# Maya-Arm-IK-FK-Setup-in-Python
The following script will generate an IK and an FK joint chain with controls based on the existing arm chain (from clavicle joint to finger end joints). The second part of this script involves matching either the FK or the IK to the other, so animators can easily switch between the two whenever they need to.
